I am a researcher at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) based at Linköping University in Sweden. I study individual and collective cultural change using computational text analysis methods. I have recently defended my thesis and am currently on the job market. Here you can check [my full CV](https://anastasia-menshikova.github.io/assets/cvMenshikovaDec2024.pdf).

In my [dissertation](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1952026&dswid=2111), I analyze how interdependencies between individuals and social spheres shape cultural change in the context of public discourse on immigration. A combination of digital trace data from social media, digitized newspaper archives, and survey data collected in Sweden and Europe provides an empirical context for my research. [Marc Keuschnigg](https://keuschnigg.org/), [Selcan Mutgan](https://www.selcanmutgan.com/), and [Måns Magnusson](https://www.mansmagnusson.com/) were my PhD advisors. 

Along with learning how to do good research, I find important making academia a friendlier place for women and supporting open discussions of academics' mental health.
